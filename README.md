# Cascade Control Proposal for the Attitude of a CubeSat 1U Satellite.
Research project where was developed a new Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) law for Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) of CubeSat satellites. 

## Year: 2016. 

## Simulations. 

### Reaction Wheel Model in Simulink. 

An early version of the RW model. 
Used the motor properties obtained from a previous project in which a DCPM motor was characterized.

### Cascade Control in Simulink. 

A multi-loop (two control loops) for the attitude control of a 1U CubeSat. 
The inner loop is about the dynamics of the characterized RW.
The external loop is about the satellite dynamics.

### Attitude Control in Simulink. 

Cascade control response with enviromental disturbes included. 

In figure:

* Magenta: reaction wheel's angular speed (\omega_r(t)).
* Red: satellite attitude in (roll (x(t))).
* Cyan: setpoint, from 0 to 1Â° in 10 seconds.
